## Step by step breakdown on how to run application: ##
<br>

**copy by running;**

```
git clone https://github.com/RemyXVX/Super-Galactic-Age-Calculator
````
**I would recommend also setting up work envirnoment after cloning by:**
```
npm init -y
```
**then:**
```
npm install
```
**afterwards:**
```
npm run build
```
**After the setup, you can then run any test and make edits with:**
```
npm run test
```
**That way you can check to see if the lines of code can pass the test. Incase of any errors that may appear, it best pratice to run lint. (Will go line for line for errors that may appear)**
```
npm run lint
```

## Known Bugs
* _The issue of making BL that would individual reflect the years after expected years of life_
